# Conway's Game of Life
I recently learned about a game called ["Game of Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It is a great example of cellular automation and how simple rules can result in complex patterns. Imagine some kind of life form living in a world. At each turn,they follow some simple rules to decide whether a life is alive or dead. In order to make the game more fun, I also added a Random button and a Clear button to help with placing the cells.
## How to Run ?
Simply run `npm install` then `npm start`. A webpage will show in the browser. Click the board to setup the initial state, or use Random button to randomize the board. Then click "Run" button to see the iterations.
