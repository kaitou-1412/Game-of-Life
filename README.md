I recently learned a game called “Game of Life.” It is a great example of cellular automation and how simple rules can result in complex patterns. Imagine some kind of life form living in a world. At each turn, they follow some simple rules to decide whether a life is alive or dead.
In order to make the game more fun, I also added a Random button and a Clear button to help with placing the cells.
